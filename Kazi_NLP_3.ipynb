Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959\\u20131960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \\\"I taught David Lewis,\\\" Smart would say in later years, \\\"Or rather, he taught me.\\\"\",\n          \"The term \\\"country\\\" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of \\\"countries\\\" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, of which 193 states are members of the United Nations, two states have observer status at the U.N. (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood. The latest proclaimed state is South Sudan in 2011.\",\n          \"The Soviet space program (Russian: \\u041a\\u043e\\u0441\\u043c\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0440\\u0430\\u043c\\u043c\\u0430 \\u0421\\u0421\\u0421\\u0420, \\\"Kosmicheskaya programma SSSR\\\") comprised several of the rocket and space exploration programs conducted by the Soviet Union (USSR) from the 1930s until its collapse in 1991. Over its sixty-year history, this primarily classified military program was responsible for a number of pioneering accomplishments in space flight, including the first intercontinental ballistic missile (R-7), first satellite (Sputnik 1), first animal in Earth orbit (the dog Laika on Sputnik 2), first human in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1), first woman in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6), first spacewalk (cosmonaut Alexey Leonov on Voskhod 2), first Moon impact (\\\"Luna 2\\\"), first image of the far side of the moon (\\\"Luna 3\\\") and unmanned lunar soft landing (\\\"Luna 9\\\"), first space rover (\\\"Lunokhod 1\\\"), first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth (\\\"Luna 16\\\"), and first space station (Salyut 1). Further notable records included the first interplanetary probes: Venera 1 and Mars 1 to fly by Venus and Mars, respectively, Venera 3 and Mars 2 to impact the respective planet surface, and Venera 7 and Mars 3 to make soft landings on these planets.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lang\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ja\",\n          \" ar\",\n          \"bn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answerable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_start\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 223,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 3964,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1058,\n        \"samples\": [\n          121,\n          59\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11976,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"early 1950s\",\n          \"Pope Eugene III\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_inlang\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\u09ed\\u09e6 \\u0995\\u09bf\\u09b2\\u09cb\\u09ae\\u09bf\\u099f\\u09be\\u09b0\",\n          \"2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}],"source":["df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ch65XvseoTkm"},"source":["# Language_Models"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fulv4VFARA91"},"source":["## Tokezination"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17782,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728430341957,"user":{"displayName":"Kazi Sohrab Uddin Titu","userId":"11681801974058749504"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"35DaZDkHR02n","outputId":"1f011470-1f0f-4e35-ff81-59502202d388"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:1601: FutureWarning: `clean_up_tokenization_spaces` was not set.
