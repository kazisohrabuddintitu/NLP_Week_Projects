Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959\\u20131960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \\\"I taught David Lewis,\\\" Smart would say in later years, \\\"Or rather, he taught me.\\\"\",\n          \"The term \\\"country\\\" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of \\\"countries\\\" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, of which 193 states are members of the United Nations, two states have observer status at the U.N. (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood.

Over its sixty-year history, this primarily classified military program was responsible for a number of pioneering accomplishments in space flight, including the first intercontinental ballistic missile (R-7), first satellite (Sputnik 1), first animal in Earth orbit (the dog Laika on Sputnik 2), first human in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1), first woman in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6), first spacewalk (cosmonaut Alexey Leonov on Voskhod 2), first Moon impact (\\\"Luna 2\\\"), first image of the far side of the moon (\\\"Luna 3\\\") and unmanned lunar soft landing (\\\"Luna 9\\\"), first space rover (\\\"Lunokhod 1\\\"), first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth (\\\"Luna 16\\\"), and first space station (Salyut 1).

Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959\\u20131960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \\\"I taught David Lewis,\\\" Smart would say in later years, \\\"Or rather, he taught me.\\\"\",\n          \"The term \\\"country\\\" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of \\\"countries\\\" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, of which 193 states are members of the United Nations, two states have observer status at the U.N. (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood.

Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959\\u20131960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \\\"I taught David Lewis,\\\" Smart would say in later years, \\\"Or rather, he taught me.\\\"\",\n          \"The term \\\"country\\\" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of \\\"countries\\\" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, of which 193 states are members of the United Nations, two states have observer status at the U.N. (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood.

Over its sixty-year history, this primarily classified military program was responsible for a number of pioneering accomplishments in space flight, including the first intercontinental ballistic missile (R-7), first satellite (Sputnik 1), first animal in Earth orbit (the dog Laika on Sputnik 2), first human in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1), first woman in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6), first spacewalk (cosmonaut Alexey Leonov on Voskhod 2), first Moon impact (\\\"Luna 2\\\"), first image of the far side of the moon (\\\"Luna 3\\\") and unmanned lunar soft landing (\\\"Luna 9\\\"), first space rover (\\\"Lunokhod 1\\\"), first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth (\\\"Luna 16\\\"), and first space station (Salyut 1).

The game series is perhaps the best-known example of the so-called of Japanese-style console role-playing games. It draws its ideas from other console RPGs of the late 1980s, most notably Enix's popular \\\"Dragon Quest\\\" series. The games have long been popular in Japan; In the US they finally broke through with \\\"Final Fantasy IV\\\" and \\\"Final Fantasy VI\\\" (these games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as \\\"Final Fantasy II\\\" and \\\"Final Fantasy III\\\"), and the international breakthrough came with \\\"Final Fantasy With VII\\\" (which was also the first game in the series released in Europe). Besides the actual \\\"Final Fantasy\\\" games, other games and products have also been published under the same name. Notable examples include \\u201cFinal Fantasy\",\n          \"The pogrom of the Armenian population of Sumgait started on the evening of February 27, one week after the appeal of the Council of People's Deputies to unify Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and according to many sources was a direct response to the Council's decision. The perpetrators were targeting the victims based solely on the ethnicity factor- being Armenian was the only criterion.  Some sources speak of premeditation ahead of the break-out of violence.  Cobbles were brought into the city to block and limit access and exit from the town; the perpetrators had previously obtained the list of addresses of the Armenian residents of the city. Warnings by Azerbaijanis sympathetic to their Armenian neighbors instructed them to leave their lights on the night of the 27th; those who shut them off would be assumed to be Armenian. According to several Armenian witnesses and Soviet military personnel, alcohol and \\\"anasha\\\", a term referring to narcotics, were brought in trucks and distributed to the crowds, although such accounts were not reported in the media. According to de Waal, notes that the attackers were armed with homemade weapons that would have taken some time and effort to manufacture, suggested a certain level of planning.\",\n          \"The CIA classifies seven countries as belonging to \\\"Western Europe\\\":\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lang\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ru\",\n          \"ja\",\n          \"fi\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answerable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_start\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 220,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 2656,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 770,\n        \"samples\": [\n          478,\n          631\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4375,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"20 May 1806 \\u2013 8 May 1873\",\n          \"Chiba Institute of Technology\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_inlang\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 97,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ven\\u00e4j\\u00e4n Neuvostoliiton federatiivisen sosialistisen tasavallan armeija ja ilmavoimat\",\n          \"pieni kuva, jota k\\u00e4ytet\\u00e4\\u00e4n korostamaan muinaista tai keskiaikaista valaistua k\\u00e4sikirjoitusta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Loader"],"metadata":{"id":"PeVNk7z9RTwI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a Dataset class\n","class ContextDataset(Dataset):\n","    def __init__(self, context, context_tokens, tokenizer, max_length=128):\n","        self.context = context\n","        self.context_tokens = context_tokens\n","        self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n","        self.max_length = max_length\n","\n","    def __len__(self):\n","        return len(self.context_tokens)\n","\n","    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n","      # Token IDs and attention masks\n","      input_ids = self.tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(self.context_tokens[idx])\n","\n","      # Truncate if the sequence is longer than max_length\n","      if len(input_ids) > self.max_length:\n","          input_ids = input_ids[:self.max_length]\n","\n","      attention_mask = [1] * len(input_ids)\n","\n","      # Mask a random token for language modeling (excluding special tokens like [CLS], [SEP], etc.)\n","      mask_idx = None\n","      if len(input_ids) > 1:\n","          mask_idx = torch.randint(0, len(input_ids), (1,)).item()\n","          input_ids[mask_idx] = self.tokenizer.mask_token_id\n","\n","      # Padding to max length\n","      padding_length = self.max_length -
